# Wireless Controller

#### Made with ❤️ by Bruno Zalcberg and Pedro Stanzani de Freitas

This is a wireless controller made with RTOS and a Raspberry Pico W. It is dedicated to the Tango Gameworks' game **Hi-Fi Rush**, although it can be used to play many other PC games. 

The controller has a rectangular shape due to the idea of making it resemble a MP3 player, which is an object directly related to the game. It also has:

- 2x analog joysticks (for camera and movement)
- 4x main buttons
- 2x bumpers (top buttons)
- 1x OLED display with a music visualizer, contributing to the game's thematic

The image below shows the block diagram that represents the controller's functionality and how each part interacts with the rest of the system.
